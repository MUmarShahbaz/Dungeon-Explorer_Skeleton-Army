# Dungeon Explorer_Skeleton Army

Demo 3 of the Dungeon Explorer game, aimed at testing the use of OOPs and Dedicated Nodes simultaneously to create complex entities whilst maximizing the reusability of the code.

With the current setup I can easily make new characters in a matter of minutes.

The game currently doesn't have any ending or restart on purpose and it will not have it later on as this is but a demo. I have tested what I needed to test.
